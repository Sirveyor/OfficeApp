- **Defining the Scope**: Clearly outline what the project will do.
Land Surveying Office Utilities
The goal of this project is to have an app that will keep track of the administrative asspects of land surveying projects except billing. It will keep track of time spent on field work and office drafting, and provide scheduling for field and office work. It will have a file manager that will keep a log of specific file use. It will also have a tool to convert dimensions from architectual units to engineering units. And it will have a reporting freature for project time and project scheduling.
