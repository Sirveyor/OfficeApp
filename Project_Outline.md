### 1. **Project Planning and Requirements Gathering**
Before writing any code, it's crucial to understand the requirements and plan the project. This involves:
- **Defining the Scope**: Clearly outline what the project will do.
- **Identifying Features**: List all the features you want in your application.
- **Creating a Timeline**: Set milestones and deadlines for each phase of the project.

### 2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
You'll need to set up a development environment to write and test your code.
- **Install Python**: Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.
- **IDE/Code Editor**: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and GitHub for repository management.

### 3. **Designing the Application Architecture**
Design the structure of your application. This includes:
- **Database Design**: Plan the database schema. You'll need tables for projects, time tracking, equipment, field work scheduling, and field crews.
- **Application Structure**: Decide on the structure of your application. For example, you might use a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

### 4. **Building the Core Features**
Start by building the core features of your application. Given your requirements, we'll focus on:
- **Time Tracking App**: Create a module to track time spent on projects.
- **File Management App**: Develop a module to open files with associated programs and log file activities.
- **Database Integration**: Store all data in a single database.

### 5. **User Interface Design**
Design the user interface (UI) for your application.
- **Tkinter**: Since you have some experience with Tkinter, we'll use it to create the UI.
- **Menu Bar and Tabs**: Implement a menu bar along the left side and tabs for each app.

### 6. **Testing and Debugging**
Test each module thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for your functions and classes.
- **Debugging**: Use debugging tools to find and fix issues.

### 7. **Deployment**
Once your application is complete and tested, deploy it.
- **Packaging**: Package your application for distribution.
- **Documentation**: Write documentation to help users understand how to use your application.

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
- **Define the Scope**: Your application will include time tracking, file management, equipment tracking, field work scheduling, and field crew management.
- **Identify Features**:
  - Time Tracking: Start/stop timers, log time entries.
  - File Management: Open files, log activities, integrate with Outlook and Excel.
  - Equipment Tracking: Track equipment usage and availability.
  - Field Work Scheduling: Schedule field work and assign crews.
  - Field Crew Management: Track crew assignments and equipment usage.
- **Create a Timeline**: Break down the project into phases and set deadlines.

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Development Environment
- **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **IDE/Code Editor**: Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
- **Version Control**: Install Git and create a GitHub account. Initialize a Git repository for your project.

#### Step 3: Designing the Application Architecture
- **Database Design**: Use SQLite for simplicity. Design tables for projects, time tracking, equipment, field work, and crews.
- **Application Structure**: Use the MVC pattern. Create models for database interactions, views for the UI, and controllers for business logic.

#### Step 4: Building the Core Features
- **Time Tracking App**:
  ```python
  import sqlite3
  from datetime import datetime

  def start_project(project_name):
      conn = sqlite3.connect('project_manager.db')
      cursor = conn.cursor()
      cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects
                        (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, start_time TEXT, end_time TEXT)''')
      start_time = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
      cursor.execute('INSERT INTO projects (name, start_time) VALUES (?, ?)', (project_name, start_time))
      conn.commit()
      conn.close()

  def stop_project(project_id):
      conn = sqlite3.connect('project_manager.db')
      cursor = conn.cursor()
      end_time = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
      cursor.execute('UPDATE projects SET end_time = ? WHERE id = ?', (end_time, project_id))
      conn.commit()
      conn.close()
  ```

- **File Management App**:
  ```python
  import os
  import sqlite3
  import subprocess

  def open_file(file_path):
      conn = sqlite3.connect('project_manager.db')
      cursor = conn.cursor()
      cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS file_logs
                        (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, file_path TEXT, action TEXT, timestamp TEXT)''')
      timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
      cursor.execute('INSERT INTO file_logs (file_path, action, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (file_path, 'open', timestamp))
      conn.commit()
      conn.close()
      subprocess.call(('open', file_path))

  def log_file_action(file_path, action):
      conn = sqlite3.connect('project_manager.db')
      cursor = conn.cursor()
      timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
      cursor.execute('INSERT INTO file_logs (file_path, action, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (file_path, action, timestamp))
      conn.commit()
      conn.close()
  ```

#### Step 5: User Interface Design
- **Tkinter UI**:
  ```python
  import tkinter as tk
  from tkinter import ttk

  class MainApp(tk.Tk):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          self.title("Survey Office")
          self.geometry("800x600")

          self.menu_frame = ttk.Frame(self)
          self.menu_frame.pack(side="left", fill="y")

          self.content_frame = ttk.Frame(self)
          self.content_frame.pack(side="right", fill="both", expand=True)

          self.create_menu()

      def create_menu(self):
          buttons = ["Time Tracking", "File Management", "Equipment Tracking", "Field Work Scheduling", "Field Crew Management"]
          for button in buttons:
              btn = ttk.Button(self.menu_frame, text=button, command=lambda b=button: self.show_tab(b))
              btn.pack(fill="x")

      def show_tab(self, tab_name):
          for widget in self.content_frame.winfo_children():
              widget.destroy()
          label = ttk.Label(self.content_frame, text=f"{tab_name} Tab")
          label.pack()

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app = MainApp()
      app.mainloop()
  ```

#### Step 6: Testing and Debugging
- **Unit Testing**: Use the `unittest` module to write tests for your functions.
  ```python
  import unittest
  from your_module import start_project, stop_project

  class TestProjectManagement(unittest.TestCase):
      def test_start_project(self):
          self.assertIsNone(start_project("Test Project"))

      def test_stop_project(self):
          self.assertIsNone(stop_project(1))

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      unittest.main()
  ```

#### Step 7: Deployment
- **Packaging**: Use tools like `pyinstaller` to package your application.
- **Documentation**: Write a README file and user manual.
